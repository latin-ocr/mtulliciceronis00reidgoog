editors in the future must continue to build' I
have compared also my own notes throughout
‘with those contained in the editions by Nauck and
Lahmeyer. These editions have proved not nearly
so uselul as Ι expected from their very extensive
circulation in Germany. My debts to thern are
aclmowledged, each in its proper place, as are also my
obligations to N'agelsbach and other writers on the
Latin ol Cicero. It may be well lor me to state that
Ι have no acquaintance with any English edition ol
the Laelius. Ι only heard ol Mr Arthur Sidgwick's
edition as forthcoming at a time when my own was
sar advanced.

I expect to have finished by Easter next my
edition ol the Cato maier (De Senectute). At that
point my series ol editions ol Cicero's works must
stop sor a time, though Ι hope to add to it in future
years.
