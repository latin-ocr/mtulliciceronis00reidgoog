8 INTRODUCTION.

De republica (the characters in which are nearly all mentioned

in the Laelius), in 52 the De legibus, all three works on alarge

scale, and entitled to rank as philosophical‚ according to ancient

ideas1. All of them shew his continued acquaintance with thc

discussions current in his time of problems which would now ’
“ be recognised as belonging to philosophy.

From 51 to 46 ac. owing first to his absence in Cilicia, then
to the civil troubles, Cicero almost ceased to write. But in the κ
latter year he was reconciled with Caesar, and as the senate and
law courts were closed against him on his refusal to com·
promise his politica] principles, he betook himself with greater
devotion than ever to literature. He began to carry out a great
plan for interpreting the best philosophical writings of the
Greeks to his cultivated sellow-countrymen. ldleness he t'elt to ¹
“be absolutely uuendurable and it seemed to him that he could
do his country no better service than by< conferring· on ita
philosophical literature of its own. Hitherto those Romans who
had studied philosophy at all had studied it iu G'reek'. The only
Latin philosophical literature was Epicurean, and putting aside
the poem of Lucretius, which had scarcely then become famous, ,
consisted entirely of books rudely written, which had however.
attained a large circulation⁹.

Cicero made no claim to originality as a philosopher, or even
toan entire andcomplete acquaintance with every detail of the
Greek systems³. His usual plan was to take one-or two leading
Greek works on the subject with which he was dealing, and to
represent t'reely in his own language their subject-matter, intro-
ducing episodes and illustrations οἱ hispwn. We shall preseutly
see how this general plan was carried out in the case os the
Laelius. ν ,
