the same year Cicero completed several oratorical works, all
extant, the Partitiones oratoriae, the Brutus or Do claris orato·
ribus, and the Orator.

In the beginning of 45 Cicero lost his beloved daughter
Tullia He passed the whole year in retirement, trying to southe
his grief by incessant writing. lh quick succession came the
De consolatione, an attempt to apply 'philosophy to the mitiga-
tion ol his own sorrow and that oi others; the Academico, an
exposition ol the N ew Academia philosophy, advocating proba-
bility as the foundation os philosophy rather than certainty; the
Definibns bonorum et malornm, a work criticising the chief views
entertained concerning ethics; the Disputationes Tnsnrlonoe,
treatingoicertainconditionsnecessarytohappinessandmorality;
the Dc notura deonrm, a work whose contents are sufficiently
indicated by its title; the De divinatione, a discussion of the
question whether the gods communicate with mankind by
augury and the like; the Coto motor or Do senectute,· the
Laelius or De ornicitia; the Dejoto, discussing Fate and Free
Will; the Paradoxa, in which certain paradoxical opinions ol'
the Stoics were set sorth; the De officior, a work on the
practical application ol moral principles to ordinary lise. All
these works are still extant, and were written almost entirely in
the years 45 and 44, Το the list must be added other works,
of 3 rhetorical nature, such as the Topica and the De optimo
genere dicendi, and some lost philosophical books, such as that
Degloria. '

The mental vigour and literary power exhibited by this series
ol works appears prodigious, when we consider their immense
compass and variety and the generally high finish oi their style,
even though allowance be made lor the sact that Cicero was
giving in Latin the substanceol Greek books with which he had
been familiar from boyhood. ln Cicero’s Latin has lived a
large portion ol the post-Aristotelian philosophy, which was
doomed tooblivion in the original Greek. ’

Itis necessary, before we leave the general subjectos Cicero’s
philosophical works, to state very briefly his philosophical views.
Cicero called himself an adherent os the New Academy. lt
