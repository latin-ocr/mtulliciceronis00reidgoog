10 INTRODUCTION.

must be clearly understood, however, that the New Academy
taught no complete philosophical system lt simply pro-
claimed the view that iu the field of knowledge certainty is
unattainable, and that all the inquirer has to do is to balance
probabilities against. each other. The New Academic therefore
was free to accept any opinions which seemed to him to have
probabilities on their side, but he was bound to be ready to
abandon thern when anything came before him which would
alter his view oi the probabilities. The New Academic, then,
not only might be, but could not help being eclectic, that is
he chose such views propounded by other schools as seemed to
hirn to be most reasonable or probable at the moment. The
three principal systems in Cicero’s time were the Stoic, the
Peripatetic and the Epicurean. With the last of these, whose
⁸supporters advocated in ethics the pursuit of pleasure‚ in science
the doctrine ot the atoms, in religion the complete inactivity of
the gods, Cicero had absolutely no sympathy. ln his time the
other two schools, the 'Stoic and Peripatetic, were divided by
comparatively unimportant differences. As regards ethics (in
the eye of the ancients almost the whole of philosophy, which
itseli was defined as ‘the artos living’) the main question
between the two schools was the amount oi importance to be
attributed to Virtue, the Stoics declaring that in comparison
with Virtue, all other things sank into absolute insignificance‚
while the Peripatetics declared that they had a certain though
infinitesimally small significante. Cicero generally takes the
Peripatetic view, though with many leanings towards some of
the ¹details ol the Stoic ethical system. The Stoic opinion that it
was the duty of the wise man to abstain irorn public lile, which

the Peripatetics contested, Cicero decisively rejected.

Our dialogue b'elongs to the ethica! worlrs of Cicero. The
De finibus contains Cicero’s view of the prtizcrjbles oi moralitys,
while the other ethical writings are concerned with the practical
applications ot' those principles. The consideration oi Friend-
