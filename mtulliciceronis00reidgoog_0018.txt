ancient moral systems, though the topic is very little elaborated
by modern philosophers. Particularly in post-Platonis times,
when the freedom oi Greek politica] lise was extinguished, and
men oi culture had to find private outlets sor their energy, was
F riendship brought into prominence. Numerous treatises were
specially devoted to it¹. Α separate dialogue was given to it by
Plato, viz. the Lysis, and two whole books oi the Nicomacluuu
Etlzics(v111. and tx.) by Aristotle. ln the Laelius, however, the
range oi questions discussed is sar narrower than was commonly
the case with the Greek philosophers who wrote on the subject.
The Greek φιλία included every form os association, even the
relations oi man to man, of citizen to citizen, of purchases, to
buyer, and the like. Cicero, however, uses auzr'ce'te‘a in a
sense which i's almost exactly that oi the English ‘friendslre'p.’
Nor does our author attempt that exhaustive discussion of all
questions which had been raised or might be raised, touching
F riendship in this narrower sense, which we find in the two
above-mentioned books of the Nicomacluou Ettrics. The
practr'ce ol friendship is discussed almost to the exclusion oi its
theory. Cicero’s treatise is indeed a kind of popular essay
dealing with those aspeets oi the subject which could best be
made interesting to readers in general. He again and again
during the course oi the dialogue emphasizes the practical
’ character of the treatise. lndeed to have made it highly specu-
lative would have ill suited the characters oi the interlocutors.

phrastus, entitled περὶ φιλίας, which seems to have been the
most famous os the many treatises on the subject. The imitation
was, on the showing of Gellius, exceedingly sree. Theophrastus
gave his own views and wrote sor philosophers; Cicero wrote for
general readers and put his statements into the mouth of
