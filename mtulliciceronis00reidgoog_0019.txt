12 ' INTRODUCTION.

Laelius, who as a distinguished Roman general and states·
man, could not be allowed to go too deeply into philosophi-
cal questions. Besides this imitation oi Theophrastus, one or
two direct imitations occur of a discourse ,of Socrates on
friendship recorded by Xenophon in his Memorabilis (2, 4-10)¹.
Further, there is a slight reference in the prooemium to the
Theaetetus oi Plato². Beyond this no distinct adaptation of
Greek originals can be traced. It is extremely doubtful, or
perhaps more than doubtful, whether Cicero used ia this treatise
the li'e'camacleeon Etlu'cs, though he knew of its existence⁸, and
had perhaps, at some time, read it. Several resemblances be-
tween that work and portions of the Laelius can be accounted
ior by the fact that many oi Aristotle's ethical utterances had
passed into commonplaces. Itis exceedingly likely that Cicero
knew Plato's Lysis, but I arn unable to point out any distinct
imitation of it⁴. No doubt Cicero read and used here and there
other Greek treatises on Friendship‚ which we do not now
possess. ln ξ 45 Cicero adapts some lines oi Euripideswhich
Plutarch says were commented on by Chrysippus in his work
nepl delier, but the verses were so notorious that there is no
reason to suspect imitation.
