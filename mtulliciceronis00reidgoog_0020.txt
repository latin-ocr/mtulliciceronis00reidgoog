is called in De ficiis r,151and in Ao Atticum 14, 21,3 Coto
moion. So the nss give to the Brntns (thus c'alled by Cicero
in De divinatione 2, 3) the second title De claris oratoribus.
Such double titles were not uncommon They are frequently
found in ancient citatious of Plato’s works and in Mss; e.g.
Φίληβος, περὶ τάγαθοῦ. Varro also wrote a great number of
books (called libri logistorin) which took their first titles from
the names of persons, their second titles from their subject·

c. Time os writing. This has been implicitly given above
iu the general account of Cicero's philosophical works. lt is
clear from De divinatione 2, 3 that when that work appeared,
the Laelius had not yet been written, while the Coto monn had
already been published ln the De officiis (which had not been
mentioned in the passage of De dr'oinotione above referred to)
there is a reference to the Lnelius. The Coto moror was writ-
ten in the spring of 44 lac. soon after Caesars death, and the
De officiis was completed in November of the same year¹. As'
Cicero was travelling during July and August, while September
and October were occupied by the De officior, and probably
April and May by the De divinatione, we shall not greatly err
if we suppose the Laelius to have been composed in June of the
year 44 uc. It wasa gloomy time sor Cicero for many reasons,
but particularly because the high hopes concerning politics
which he entertained on eaesars death were already shattered⁴
The circumstances of the time are to a great extent reflected in
the tone of the dialogue. ,

d Τ he [ουκ os tire dialogue. In general, Cicero followed in
his philosophical works the plan of Aristotle’s dialogues, now
lost, rather than that of the dialogues of Plato. ln the former
there was more of exposition and less of dr'scnssion than in the
latter; one person stated his views on some question, and the
company in attendance only made occasional remarks, without
attempting to debate the question. ln nearly all Plato’s dia·
