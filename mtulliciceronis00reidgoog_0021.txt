logues one person, Socrates, is overwhehningly prominent, but
he constantly endeavours to drag the other personages into the
discussion cicero, in most of his philosophical works (the
T asculan Disputatrhns forms an exception more apparent than
real) avoids the quick interchange of question and answer which
is characteristic of Plato. Aristotle’s·dia10gues¹ were more
