Cicero everywhere speaks in the most eulogistic terms ol
Laelius’ character. All authorities were unanimous as to liis
unswerving rectitude¹. His seli-control and moderation were
remarkable². ‘Like Socrates, he never shewed in his sace
throughout lite the effect produced on his mind by changes of
fortunat. His gentlencss and affability were great⁴. His cheer·
iulness and humour were famoust

During his lile and aiter his death Laelius bore the title
sapiens or ‘the wise⁰‚' a title which implies more of practical
than intellectual wisdom‚ though it would not have been given
to any one who was destitute oi culture and literary excellence.
Altogether Laelius is Cicero's typical example oi the best results
os cultivation acting on a character which exhibited in their
sullest extent the ideal Roman virtues. He is introduced as an
interlocutor into two other dialogues, the Cato maior (De'scneo
tute) and the Dc republica (along with Scipio, Fannius, and,
Scaevola).

The iriendship of Laelius and Scipio was one of the most
famous in antiquity. Laelius, says Cicero, reverencedlScipio as =
ag0d3 Scipio looked up to Laelius (his senior) as a parent⁷.
The views oi friendship which Laelius gives in the dialogus are
said by him to be mainly those ol Scipio.

The other interlocutors are the two sons-inlaw of Laelius,
QMucius Scaevolaland Gaius Fannius. Scaevola belonged ,
to aiamily ol lawyerst, andwas himself exceedingly distinguished
Ἰ lor his knowledge oi the law. He was born about 157 and
