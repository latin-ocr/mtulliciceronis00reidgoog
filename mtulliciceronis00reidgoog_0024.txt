important influence was added, that os the Greek philosophy.
Although the wisdom oi the Greeks was known in part to the
Romans at a much earlier time its practical power over them
dates from the famous Athenian embassy oi 153 isc. composed
ol the three great philosophers Carneades the Academic,
Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic. Alter this
time all the Greek systems struck root at Rome, but by far the
greatest influence was exerted by Stoicism, of which nearly all
the members of Scipio’s society had a more or less strong
tincture. Thus Scipio himself was devoted to the society of the
Stoic philosopher Panaetius; Laelius had learned Stoicism
both from Panaetius and Diogenes. There are many tinges of
Stoicism traceable in our dialogue. These noble Romans, how-
ever, adopted the Stoic philosophy more on account os its utility
in supplying a foundation sor theories of law and government
than as a form oi faith. The Stoicism they professed was also
a Stoicism deprived oi its paradoxes and specially adapt'ed to
Roman taste's. ln this form it ultimately exercised a proiound
influence on the national lise of Rome. ’

Though the prevalent bent of the Scipionic circle was towards
Stoicism, it was sar from reiecting the society oi those who
adhered to other systems. Thus Clitomachus, the New
Academic, was the friend oi many Romans oi high station in
his time. ’ ·

On the literary side the circle ol' Scipio and Laelius was
strong. To it belonged Polybius, the great historian, Lucilius
the satirist, and the dramatists Terence and Pacuvius, with
many others scarcely less distinguished.

We cannot here give any detailed account oi the persons
who formed this brilliant society, but -must confine ourselves to
such information as is necessary to illustrate the Laelius. ln
