Iproceed to spcak ol some other friends oi Scipio who are
mentioned in our dialogue. Chiel ol these is 1„ Furius Philusl,
consul ol the year 136, a marr os great knowledge, and high
character, and a friend and patron ol Greek literati. He is
thought worthy by Cicero to rank beside Cato and Laelius², and
is one of the interlocutors in the De re publica.

P. Rupilius was consul in 132 and exercised great severity
against the partisans ol Ti. Gracchus. His consulship is said
to have been due to the aid oi Scipiot He commanded in
Sicily against the insurgent slaves and established a code ol
laws ior the administration ol that province.

Μ’. Manilius⁴, consul in' 149, commanded in Africa sor some
time against the Carthaginians with Scipio as one ol his officers.
He was a very eminent lawyer, and a close friend oi Laelius and
Scipio, appearing in the De republica along with them.

Spurius Mummius⁶ seems to have been a very different man
lrom his brother the destroyer ol Corinth. He had both wit
and literary ability, which recommended him to the very in·
timate friendship oi Scipio, with whom he is joined in Cicero’s
De republica. When, to secure Scipio’s satety, the senate
dispatched him on an embassy to Asia, Mummius was his
companion. Mummius spent some time in Achaia as legatur
to his brother and thence sent witty epistles in verse to his
friends at home⁶· Apparently he was unpopular and unsuccess·

sulas apolitician and devoted himself to study‚ becoming a
strong Stoic. We hear ol him that he was particularly noted

sorbis detestation oi the teachers of Rhetoric.
