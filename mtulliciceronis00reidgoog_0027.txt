Α. §u Cicero's acquaintance with the Scaevolae §2
Scaevola, the augur, happened to speak one day ol a notorious
quarrel between two quondam friends, P. Sulpicius Rufus and
Q. Pompeius. [Sulpicius was originally on the aristocratic side,
but being plebeian tribune in 88 uc„ he became a tool oi Marius
and proposed some revolutionary laws. llis former friend
Pompeius was consul, and vigorously opposed him In a light,
the sou oi Pompeius was slain; aiter which Sulla entered the
city with an army and Sulpicius was killed] d 3 This led
Scaevola to report a conversation concerning friendship which
laelius had held with his two sons-in-law, Scaevola himself and
Fannius. This conversation Cicero has sreely rendered § 4.
The work is done at the request oi Atticus, and is now presented
to him, as the Cato mater had been Cato was the most
suitable Roman to speak oi old age3 and Laelius, whose intimacy
with Scipio was iar-iamed, to speak of friendship. ᾗ ς. The
whole speech oi Laelius will remind htticus oi his own character·
istics asa friend. The conversation takes place a few days
aller the death ol Africanus the younger <¹²9 tte).
