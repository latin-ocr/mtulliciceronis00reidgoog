Arch. 15 ego multos homines excellenti animo ac virtute fuisse et sine
doctrina naturae ipsius habites...gravis exstitisse sisteor ete, and Verg.
Georg. 4, 5 mores et studia. Studio et doctrina is not an instance of
tv lm δυοῖν, and should not be translated ‘hy seat sor learning’‚ but
'by devotion and culture‘; cf. Arch. 3 otium ac studium ,· De Or. 1,

‘only' unexpressed‚ but occasionally he uses modo, and once (head. a, 74)

Apollinis...iudicatum: Socrates in Plato’s Apology p. ar Α merely
says that the oracle declared that no one was wiser than himself (μηδένα
σοφώτερον εἶναι). The person who put the enquiry to the oracle‚ Chae·
sephon, a pupil of Socrates, was dead when the trial took place, but his
brother bore evidence to the facts. Xenophon in his Apologyu 14 (if it
be his) makes Socrates speah more definitely about the oracles-sivetlesd
Ἀπόλλων μηδένα εἶναι ἀνθρώπων ἐμοῦ μήτε ἐλευθεριώτερον μήτε δικαιότερον
μήτε σωφρονέστερον. In another part of the Apology by Plato (33 c)
Socrates says that the life he followed had been enjoined on him by the
Delphian god eat ἐκ μαντείων rat ἐξ inuretur. The Scholiast on Aris·
tophanes’ Nubes 114 gives there the actual words of the answer to
