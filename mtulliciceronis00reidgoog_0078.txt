tiotrs (adnotatas), which have their counterparts in other men; only

evenire on the other required the word to be used ol good somnne only.
Seyffert rightly compares contingere with προσήκειν· aad explains its
meaning to be (in the best Latin) the happening ol something which is
natural or to be expected under the circumstances. Cf. N .D. ι,17 non
