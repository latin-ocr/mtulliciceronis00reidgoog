The picureans are chiefly, but not solely‚ inted at· Some of the
Peripatetico and also some of the N evr Academics held or at least some·
times advocated the same views.

mortur's...r'uro.· the principal ‘reverent rites’ pald to the dead are
mentioned iu Cic. Leg- o, 55 sq.; cf. especially 57 mrelta relrgr'osa r'ura.
Our passage has also much resemblance to Tusc. r, 26 sq.

sr'...arbr'trarentur: cf. Tusc. r, η caerimonias qreas masr'mr's ingeniis
praediti nac tanta trrr'a coluissent... nisi haereret in eorum mentibus
mortem oon interitum esse onrrrr’a tollentem atque delentem red quandam
eeasr' utaperiamus. Observa the tense of arbitrarentur and haereret,
for which modern feeling would require the pluperfect. Cic. realises the
past (for the moment) as present, and so looks ou the condition as not
wholly past but still continuing. The usage is in fact similar to the substi-
tution of the present for the past (for the sake of vividness) in historical
narratives. Osten tort rotasis and aodosis contain averb ln the
imperfect where we should expect the pllrperfect (ag. Verr. 5, 89; Sest.
63); but it does not often hoppen that the apodosis has averb in the lu·
perfect, while the verb in the protasis stands in the imperfect. as in gat.

same sort are common in Greek conditional sentences.

vet eius: in Cat. m. 78 Cic. ap eals just as he does here to the
{Lyutlhagoreans aad to Socrates as au orities for the immortality of the

qrer': rc. dr'cebat,· cf. for the ellipse r, l. ro redde hoc aliar.
non: supply quotiens a'e troc re diceret.

tum hoc tum r'llud .· the later Academics, particularly Arcesilas and
comendes, professing to follow Socrates, made a practice of arguing on
both sides of every question, and declared that certainty was unattain-
able, though probable conclusions might be formed. They prided them·
