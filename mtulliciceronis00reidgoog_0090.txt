Audax negotium, dicerem impudens, nisi hoe institutum postea transla-
tum ad uestros philosophos esset; De Or. r, ιοι quid l miei nune uos
tamquam alicru' Graeculo otioso et loquaci et firrfesse docto etque medita
quaestiunculam deque rneo arbitratu loquar, penitis ,· so ib. 3, ιι7.

7ο quamvis subito: ‘however suddenly' 3=fam subito quam vis.

magnum operest: so in De Or. ι, ¹03 Cicero says of Gorgias per-
maguum quidm suscipere ae proyfferi videbatur. For magnum opus=a
great taslr, cf. Academ. ι, ιιι7 usc. 3, 79 and 84; Orat. 75.
3¹ quae disputari de ansier'ub possunt: this refers to Fannius’ words
above, l. ιι de amicitia disputaris. There is a contrast between dis-
putari and horreri: Laelius at first declares himself unable to give
a scientifie and philosophical discussion ol friendship3 he ean only give
some practieal drrections concerning it.

32 censeo petetis: censeo is wrongly explained by mest editors (as
Seyffert, Lahmeyer, N auch) to be parenthetic, peratis being supposed to
be a sub'unctive used in the hortative sense Putatis, however, is
directly dependent on censeo, ut being suppressed, as it often is with
curo, caveo, sinere, horreri, and many other verbs3 cf. also n. on ιο, 1.4
cave; 47, 1.8 neeesse. Sometimes the ut is inserted, as in Caes. Β. C.'
ι, 67, ¹3 Cic. Phil. 3, 37.

P. 88.
ι αιιίιμιιιιέίι eta: for the sense cs. 5 104.

nihil est enim: note enim, third word in the clause 7 had it stood Α

second est would not have been so emphatic. ct. 50, 1. 7.

lam naturae aptum .· for the separation of tam from aprum cf. n. on
ιο, l. 8 quam id recte. The phrases naturae aptus, ad naturam aptus
ore common in Cic. (as fin. 4, 46; Off. r, roo) and are of Stoic origin.
'l'he Stoics defined virtue as being τῇ φύσει ὁμολογουμένως ζῆν (naturae
&munienter uiuere). Cf. below 19, l. ιι naturam optimam bene vivendi
ucem.

ι ael secundas uel adversas: so Cic. says of literature (Arch. 16) secuu-
das res meant, adversis perfugium ae salarium prudent.

ere

3, nisi r‘n bonis: ‘except in the case of good men'. Cf. 65, p. ¹49, ·
l. 3, where infir druos corresponds to iu bonu here.

dated that only perfect men (sapientes, σοφοὶ οι οπουδοῖοιεύοιιί, since
none but the σοφὸς is σπουδαῖος) could be friends. So Diog. Laert. 7,
124 τὴν φιλίαν ἐν μόνοις τοῖς σπουδαίοις εἶναι λέγουσι, aud Aristotle Eth.
Nic. 8 and 9 passim ,· also Socrates in Xen. Mem. ι, 6, ιο. The phrase
ad meum resecare, literally ⁴ to cut back to the quiclr ’, is here identical in
meaning with the uebte'lius disserere that follows, and with the subtilius

quaerere of 7, Ι. ιο. .
