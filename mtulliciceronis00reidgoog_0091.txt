concedant ut .· when concedere means to give periodum to do sonte-
thing it regularly takes ιιι with subjunctive, but when it means to admit
a fact it is regularly followed by the accusative with infinitive. The
subjoined passage shews the distinction, Rose. Am. 54 concedo tibi ut ea
praetereas quae, cum taces, nulla erse cootcedir. Sometimes, however,
Cicero substitutas the subjunctive construction ior the infinitiva (but not
vice versa) as in our passa e and Fin. 5, 78 si Stoicis concedis ut virtus
rota vitam efficiat beatam. ln such passages the effect ol the admission is
rather looked ιο than the admission itsell. The meaning here is‘let them
make such an admission as ιο bring it about that these were good men’. ’
