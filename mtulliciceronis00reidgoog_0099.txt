Vatrrrirari is sometimes used hp Cic in a bad semefto talk nonsense,
todrrvel, asrn Fam. a, 16, 6. he great philosophical poem of Ern-

pedoclea περὶ φύσεως, the title ot which rs borrowed by Lucretiuslor

is poem ‘De rerum natura’, and which he greatly imitates, contained
many passages that seemed to sober-minded readers to border on mad-
aess; ct. Acad. a, ¹4 r'rtr' exclamant mente incitati, Empedocles quadem
rainardum mitri furere mitratur, also Lacr. 1, 727 carmina quin etaiam
divini pectan‘s eius vociferantur. As the word vatrnnarr' sometimes
means ‘to prophesy’, there may be a reference to the lact that Empe-
docles claimed to possess prophetie and magio powers.

ao totoque arundo: this is merely explanatory ol rerum natura, which
hppirpbpnpppnrpe meaning. Trans. ‘in the constitution ol things and tlte

constarent...discordiam: the passage closely corresponds with the well-
· ltnown lines ol Empedocles: ral τοῦτ’ ἀλλάσσοντο διαμπερὲς οὐδαμὰ
λήγει Ι ἄλλοτε μὲν φιλότητι συνερχόμεν’ alr lv dama} altore δ’ οῦ δίχ’
ἔκοονο φορεύμενα νείκεον ἔχθει, where συνερχόμενα correspondit with cotr-
starent here and φορεύμενα with nravmntur. Empedocles held that two
rinciples were perpetually at war in the universe, one the principle ol
fove or lriendshi (attraction) constantly tending to unite the scattered
portions oi the ἄορ elements, fire, air, earth aad water, so as to bri
things into existence, the other the principle ol hate or enmity (repffi
sion), tending to decompose bodies into their constituent parts.

trapa: ol course the object, as anaeticum is the subject, oi the verb coa·

cre.

at hoc.- ‘this principle ’, νὶι. that lriendship is a uniting torre, hatred
a destructive torre.

' aa onmes mortales: here=simply anrncs homines. Cicero never uses

mortalis ior hamo without some attribute, though the usage is very oom-

rnon in Sallust, Tacitus, and the later Latin prose. Caesar altogether
avoids the word Cl. mortalis neruo in 18, 1. 7.

et intellegunt et rc prodant: ‘not only understand but approve by
their actions ’. «

23 siquando aliquod: Cicero, like the other Latin writers, osten seems
capricrous in his use ol qaartdo and aliquanda, uid (qaod...) and aliquid
(aliquod...)attersi. Forri uandoalriyuid (οβ’ uod... cl.Verr.4.126;
DeOr.1, 124, Forriqu' mund...) aliqm Cluent. ¹405 Fam. 9,

673 Sest. ¹4· lt is commonly said that when· the words with ati- are
used atterri they are more emphatic than the simple tornis ;·thep es,
however, do not always bear out the supposition. Ct ay, p. walese&

...castitia ‘has been displayed '. Ct. n. on ay, p. 37, l. 6.

²4 adeundas: aie. pro ama'ca‘: in the one case the amicus meets the
danger alone, and protecta bis friend, in the other both lriends tace it
together. Theuseolr'nlrtherarneasthatino.p.30,l.3tnprusrh.
