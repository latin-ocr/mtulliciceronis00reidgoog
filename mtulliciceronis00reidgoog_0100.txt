new play aller his eightieth year (Cic. Brut. 119), and Scipio died in

Greek dramatists The plays of Pacuvius were all palliatae and closel
copied from Greek originale, but it is not exactly known on what Greei
play the Dulorestes was founded. It certainly did not follow the Iphi-
genia in Tauris of Euripides, which treats the same story. The rex was
l'hoas, king of the Tauric Chersonese. ¹

asmall anachronism, because the first permanent theatre at Rome was
erected by Pompeius, before which time it is believed that the audience
stood throughout the exhibition of the plays. The temporary booths,
however, may have contained rough galleries; cf.Tae. Ann. 14, 1ο with
Nipperdey's n. With Cicero’s words cf. Att. a, 19, 3 Curioni stantes
