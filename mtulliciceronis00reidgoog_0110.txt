535] uorsa 103

because litterae in the sense ol an epistle has no singular) we have
only one passage like the present, viz. Oll'. 1, 7 leges. et proximae
quaeque demeres. A glance at that passage will skew that ⁸the reading
ulutatust²lt3tftl.tltz³pl.tzttt3l⁰‘ultusultus
busque may be used as ἑκάστοις is osten in Greek, to mean ‘each set
ol people'3 or the plural may be due merely to assimilation with
plerisque. It may further be mentioned that Cicero does not use
expressions like tonsa quisque, or melior quisque, except when the
comparative is preceded by quo (que qrer'sque metior).

18 discidia: n. on 13, l. 16.
iusta: ι’. e. with good reason on one side or the other.

19³ crem...postuluretur.· t'or this subjunctive see Robyfl ι711, Kennedy
arr.
ιο uaurnamuaeu: su.3,44.6muauraeemuu1uuua. '
adiutores ad: the common construction ol adiutor in Cic. is witha
genitive of the thing wherein aid is given, (but dative oi the person to l

whom sid is given, as in 41, p. 41,1. 1); cl. however Flacc. ι adiutor
ad rem perficiendam. Adt'uvare ad, adiumentum ad often occur.

quod 'etat ‘since those who declined‚ however honourable their(
action was, were by those whom they refused to obey charged with,

disregarding the claims ol sriendship'. Madviffi, Em. Liv. p. 417
ed. 1, seems to misunderstand this passage, throug taking quod as the

neuter pronoun, instead ot the conjunction ι so others, Halm included.

11 deserere: sor the infinitive dependent on the personal arguerentur
instead ol the impersonal construction argueretureos deserere, cf. n. on 9,
p· 19, l. 3² ut videris: also Rosc. Am. ,37 Roscius arguitur ocerite'sse
parrer& also ⁸quaeruntur in 16, 1.1ι; coustitrunds' suut in 56. p. 45,

30, perspuruutur ιιι 63, l. 5.

²3 quidvis: ⁸ anything and everything '. ‚aa

²4 omnm.- not different in sense lrom quidvis above· Cf. Att. 9, ι8, 3
ad omnia descensurum (‘would stick at nothing ⁹).

ι 5 inveterata: ‘undying' ; often used with ira, odium etc.
16 sempiterna: in contrast to amicitiae sempiternae in 32, l. ²9·

. haec etc. .· ‘these almost destined ends threaten friendships‚ he said,
in such numbers that etc.’. Quasi merely modilies the metaphor (n. on

pap. ²28, l. 1) ; fatrem is used very much ia its poetical sense of mersor
r err us. ι

18 diceret siu· videri: these words take the place ol esset, which would
be used if the sentence were entirely logical. Cl. De Or. 1, 178 illud
Sicuti eur’ curn fertilioris quidum quereretur quod diceret uxorem sucus
