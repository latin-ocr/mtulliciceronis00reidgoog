4 prorsus: goes with nulli, nol abhorrentium· ‘to none at all'.

6 uestra causa: many editions have uestri, and in the sixth edition os
Nigelsbach's Stilistilr p. 506 the passage is still quoted with uestri. Cic.
however never says enei tui sui nostri uestri causa, but always meo causa
etc. The only passage in which the genitive is still retained by recent
editors is Verr. 3. ιιι sui causa, and many scholurs, wilh whom 1 agree,

think that sua should be read there. Cf. Madvig on F in. ι, 76.
7 ficamus eta: sor the sense cl. 5 ιό.

causa amicorum: note the chiasmus in uestro causa...cuusa amicerum, ,
and cl. 55, l. ιι. The repetition ol causa (which is osten ten ont in the

the chiasmus (lor which see n. on 23, l. ιο).

precari: note the omission ol aliquid.

himself understands the opinion in Tusc. 3, ‘73 praeclarum illud est
et, si quaeris, rectum qumque et verum ut eosqui nobis canisimi esse
deleam aeque ac uosmet‘rpsos autemus. The opinion in lact was an
answer to the question discussed by Aristotle ιιι Eth. Nlo 9, e. 8
