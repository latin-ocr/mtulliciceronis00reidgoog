134 DE AMICITIA. ’ [373-

ι ιιι.

3 sustinere: Seyffert rightly explains aestiuare here to mean altari oneri
parem esse, quoting Verr. 3, 189 nam cum oratori oiim ali‘quad imponi·
tur, oratrbnis ipsius vis ac ratio cann'deranda est, quidm marthure, quid
pati, quid efficere possit ac debeat. Trans. ‘you must confer on each

rson just so much as you in the first place can secure to him, next as
li whom you love and aid is able to hear’. For the omission of possit
to be supplied from possis cl. n. on 30, p. 3⁸· l. 5.

uon...neque: ci. n. on 10, l. 4. Notice that there is a slight aua·
coluthon, the form oi the sentence being changed, and ior ¹thu proper
clause introduced by a second neque the clauses introduced by utare
substituted. ct.n.0n45,l.19parrtm. The unemphatic ιιι should be
noticed ς it is our English ‘you’ sor ‘one'.
4 excellas: ci. excellentissim 69, p. 50, 1. ι.

5 perducerer lit. ‘to bring through', ie. as Seyffert explainunthrough

(potuit...non patuit: ci. n. ou ro, l. rs. In Tusc. 4, 4ο Rupilius is
sai to have taken his brother's deleat greatly to heart; and Pliny, Nat.
Hist. 7, ἕ rsa (where some recent edd. have Rutilium wrongly) enlarges
the story by making him die immediately on hearing the result oi the
election.

6 efficere: facere would not have done here, since fircera aliquam corr-
sulem means ‘to vote ior some one's electiori as cousul'.

8 amicitiaer'itdicandaa artat: :iudicandum estde amicitiis ‘adecision
must be come to about friendships’, though Cicero would not say iudi·
carc aniriitias sor de amicita.

corroboratis...aetatibrts: ‘when strength and steadiness have oome
over the mind and lite’. Seyffert wrongly insists on taking these ubla-
tives (which are ablatives absolute) us ablatives oi measure aiter iudi·
candae surrt ‘by the strengthening and steadying oi the mind and liie'.
llud Cic. meant this he would have written corroborandis. But how can
, it be said that advanciug years supply a measure or standard lor judging
about friendships? The confirmata or corroborata aetas is the timeor*
lise immediately succeeding youth, the καθεστηκυῖα ἡλικία oi Thucydides ς
ci. pro Caelio 4¹ qua varietate nan moda haec actas sed iam corroborata
caperetur. The opposite expression is infinitissimum tempus aetatu in
Acad. a, 9 ς Flacc. 5.

rr habere: the construction is carried on as thou h oportet irtdr'care dr
amicitiis or something similar had preceded; old edd. indeed insert
oportet, which is unnecessary. Iu Fin. a, ¹03 quad ri dies notandusfur't,
euiirrre patius quo iratur arr eum quo sapiens sactus est the words oportet

arctare have to be supplied lrom natandru. ,In his n. there Madvig eir-
cellently illustmtest e usage both from Latin land irom Greek.
