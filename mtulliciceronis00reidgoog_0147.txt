naturam optimam bene nundi ducent.

4 r‘n qua omnia innunt: ‘ which brings with it everything'.

5 hosustos...iucunditas: the enumeration consists ol three brancha,
the last of the three being subdivided (tranqm'llitas atque imunditas).
Had iucunditas and trorrqm'llitos occupied in the enumeration the ωηο
place as the other two things mentioned. Cicero must have left out
atque. See n. on ra. p. 31. l. 7. 1·“οτικμιωιλι see n. on aa, l. ²43
for the collocation tranquillitas autimi alque iucunditas n. on 8, l. aa
cum summi viri tum astutissimi. Seyffert seems to think that honam
is not used here in its ordinary Ciceronian sense of ‘morality’, though
he does not say what meaning he gives it.

6 ut et...poss2't: this clause is one of the most difficult in the treatise,
though passed over by Nauck and Lahmeyer. lt seems to contaiu a
tacit protest against the Stoic ethics which made honestos (τό καλόν

vito cf. n on 45, l. o 5 beate nondum) contains other t rngs as well, and
that the erscction ol friendship and the perfectiou of happiness are
inextricabiy connected.
