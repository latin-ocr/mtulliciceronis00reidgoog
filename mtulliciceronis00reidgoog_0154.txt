Iex...Crassr': C. Licinius Crassus, tribune in 145, proposed to make
election to allpriesthoods go by popular vote. When a vacancy occurred
in a priestly college the remaining members filled up the vacancy as
they pleased. Α measure like that of Crassus was carried in 104 by
Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, a tribune. In opposing the law of Crassus,
Laelius (whose oration is mentioned in Brut. 833 N. D. 3, 5 and 4 ,in
which last passage it is called arrreola) maintained that the state harl no
right to control the order of religioas obsemance heuneus methorl
was adopted to get over this objection. The electiora to priesthoods
was at an assembly of a minority (17) of the 35 tribes, the particular
tribes which took part in it being determined by lot. wtnle, theo·
retically, a resolution of the minority of the nation had no binding effect,
and therefore could not be offensive to the gods, still in practice the
colleges were bound to appoint the persons so nominated, thou h the

Plutarch, life of C. Gracchus c. 5, tells the tale of C. Gracchus, and as-
signa to the act a democratic purpose. Our passage certainly seeum to
counienance Plutarch ln this, but Lange, Rdmrsche Alterthiimer 11¹ 443,
denies that the act had any political aim. He connects it with a change
in the wotin at ublic assemblies. 'l'his originally took lace in the

smne. Lange thinks that when the voting was transferred from the
comitium to the saepta (enclosures) the speakers naturally turned their
backs on the comitium and laced the saepta, the rostra being placed be·
tween them. The matter is far from clear, and lange's explanation
menas scarcely to fit in with our passage.
