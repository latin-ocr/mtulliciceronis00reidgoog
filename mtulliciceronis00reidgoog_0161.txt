In ι86ι Halm published (in Vol. lv ol the revision ol Orelli’s
edition ol Cicero’s works, continued by Baiter and Halm) a text of the
laelius based on a collation ol the readings of six uss. Much thebest
of these is the codex Gordianus, now at Wollenbiittel, written in the xth
century. This Halm marks G. Since his edition appeared two other
mss ol equal-some would say of superior-authority have come to
light, both oi which were used by Baiter iu revising the Laelius for the
edition os Cicero’s works brought out by himself and Kayser in 1863 ancl
1864. One of these two uss isin a private library at Paris, and was
first described by Th. Mommsen in the Rheinisches Museum, 1863,
p. 594 sq. It belongs to the end os the 1xth or beginning os the xth
, century, and is commonly known as Codex Parisinus, and denoted by
P.¹ There asc two lacunae, one aiter the word nmgnos in 5 75 ιο the
word ctiam in ἕ 787 the other from peccasse in ἓ 9ο ιο dc Scipione in
5 96. The other sss is at Munich. Ιι also belongs to the xth century,
and ls known as codex Monacensis, being denoted by Μ. It has lost the
part containing the first ten chapters.

Unsostunately, the information nt hand concerning P and M is far
from sufficient to enable us to determine their real salue. We possess
, only an incomplete collation ol P by Mommsen, which leaves the read-

, lngs ol many important passages in doubt. An overwhelming authority
