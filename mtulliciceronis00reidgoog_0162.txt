APPENDIX ΟΝ THE YEXY. 155 Ι

is assigned to thic‘ns by Baiter, Lahmeyer and others. My judgment
spon the existing evidence is that their estimate is exaggerated. P has
peculiar errors ol its own, aad there isa most singular agreement in
nany places between it and Halm's D (vader Vindobenensr's saec. xv')
which any one who reads Halm’s critical notes will see to be so grossly
:orrnpt as to be practically worthless.

ot M we have still less internarium-nothing indeed beyond the
eadings Baiter gives t'rom a collation by Karl Halm. While 1 have
:arelullyweighed the rtss evidence on every point, even the minatest,
:he general result has been that when any two ot these three MSS, via.
tl G P, are ngreed, Ihavc adopted the reading, while I bave seldom
band it necessary to take a reading given by any one ol them, when
insupported by other evidence. Very rarely havel had to depart from
he amanus ol the three. These three mss give an unusually sound
rasis lor the text ol the Laelius. ,

l. 15. adedere: some ttss have utebaris, but although in the second
›erson singular ol the present indicative deponent and passive Cicero
ommonly uses the torm in -rr's, he oltener has the form in ·re in the ’
eoond person singular ol the imperfect (indicative and subjunctive) and
