p. 11. Greek sources of the dialogus. Since my work first appeared
(1879) 1 have read two pam blets bearing on the Greek sources ol
the Laelius. The first is by liraxator. entitlml ‘Quid in corescrs'bendo
Ciceronis Laelio voluerint Aristotelis Etlsiron Nicosrsaclsorum (sic) de
amicitia libri’ (llallc 1871). Its ohJect is to sbcw that Cicero directly
imitated Etb. Nic. 8. 9 throughout the Laelius. Braxator points
out a number of verbal resemblances between the two works‚ nearly all
os which are quoted in my notes. But he neglects to notice the great
‹livergence between the two treatises in subject-matter and arrange·
ment. ls Etb. Nic. 8, 9 had been the basis ol the Laelius, we
should have had striking correspondence in the treatment os tlte theme.
Altogether Braxator does not much advanco the problem towards a
solution. His work is hasty, as a sign oi which it may be stated that
the pamphlet contains perhaps more misprints than were ever before
crowded together in the sume space. ·

The second essay, that o Heylbut ‘De Theophrasti libris erpi
φιλίας’ (B0nn 1876). is a more caresul roduction. Heylbut seeks to
risibili?tilithi?hiskinium..nihilist
Theo hrastus. The verbal resemblances between the Laelius and the
Eth. ic. would thus be ex lained. Heylbut believes th'at Cicero had
before him only excerpts {lom Theophrastus contained in a work by
{plmte ossher author, and he suspects tbe same may be the case with

aare .

My own investigations lead me to think that the statements about
friendsltip in the Laelius and those in De Finibus a. 4, 5 go back
to a common source, and that possibly Plutarch also used this source.
'The matter however is too intricate sor argument here. If Hirzel's
views of the sources of the De Finibus be correct, we shall thus be led
back to Antiochus os Ascalon, the philosopher from whom Cicero
drew so much elsewhere. But while many oi Hirzel’s arguments carry
me with them, there are difficulties which sor the present prevent me
srorn giving a confident opinion.
